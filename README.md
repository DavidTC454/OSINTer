## What is OSINTer?
OSINTer is a Open Source Intelligence (CTI) tool, which effectively collect
articles from relevant news sources, and provides the contents of the articles
to the users for ease of access to the newest and most relevant information on
current threats, vulnerabilities, and news in the world of CTI. The solution is
a server, deployable via ansible, which allows CTI teams to effectively gather
relevant information and store it for their independant needs. Each user has
the ability to identify relevant articles and reports from the webservice
interface, and either save these articles using the webservice user
functionality, or download markdown files consisting of the contents of the
articles, which can then be processed further using Obsidian.  This webservice
also features a web-based API, which allows developers to utilize the same
functionality to retrieve collected articles and utilize this information for
further analysis
